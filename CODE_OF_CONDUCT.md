# Code of Conduct

## The Gist

Be cool. We're all here to make system configuration less painful.

## The Slightly Longer Version

This project is maintained by one person in their spare time. There's no community manager, no moderation team, just me reading GitHub notifications.

With that in mind:

### Do

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intentions
- Give feedback that you'd want to receive
- Remember that everyone's learning (especially with Nix)

### Don't

- Be a jerk
- Harass anyone
- Make others uncomfortable
- Use this project to promote unrelated stuff

## Enforcement

If someone's being disruptive, I'll ask them to stop. If they don't, I'll block them. Simple as that.

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces: issues, pull requests, discussions, and any related communication.

## Reporting

If something's wrong, email me or open a private issue. I'll handle it.

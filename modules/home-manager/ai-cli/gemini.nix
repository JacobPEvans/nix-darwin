# Gemini CLI Configuration
#
# Returns home.file entries for Google Gemini Code Assist CLI.
# Imported by home.nix for clean separation of AI CLI configs.
#
# CRITICAL - tools.allowed vs tools.core:
# =========================================
# DO NOT USE tools.core FOR AUTO-APPROVAL!
#
# Per the official Gemini CLI schema:
# - tools.allowed = "Tool names that bypass the confirmation dialog" (AUTO-APPROVE)
# - tools.core = "Allowlist to RESTRICT built-in tools to a specific set" (LIMITS usage!)
#
# Using tools.core LIMITS what tools Gemini can use, it does NOT grant permissions.
# Always use tools.allowed for auto-approved commands.
#
# Schema reference: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/schemas/settings.schema.json
#
# Configuration format:
# - allowedTools: List of auto-approved tools (bypass confirmation dialog)
# - excludeTools: List of permanently blocked commands
#
# Permission files:
# - gemini-permissions-allow.nix - allowedTools (auto-approved commands)
# - gemini-permissions-deny.nix - excludeTools (blocked commands)
# - gemini-permissions-ask.nix - Reference only (Gemini doesn't support ask mode)

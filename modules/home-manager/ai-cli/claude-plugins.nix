# Claude Code Plugins Configuration
#
# Manages official Anthropic plugins and commands from:
# - anthropics/claude-code (plugin marketplace)
# - anthropics/claude-cookbooks (commands and agents)
#
# Strategy:
# 1. Configure plugin marketplaces and enabled plugins (modular structure)
# 2. Copy useful commands/agents from claude-cookbooks to ~/.claude/
#
# Plugin Configuration:
# - Marketplaces and plugins are defined in modules/home-manager/ai-cli/claude/plugins/
# - Organized by category: official, community, infrastructure, development, business
# - See claude/plugins/default.nix for the complete structure
#
# Migration Notes:
# - Removed: "review-pr-ci" - replaced by code-review plugin (/code-review)

# known_marketplaces.json is NOT Nix-managed - Claude Code owns it at runtime
# to support auto-update and dynamic marketplace management via the TUI.
#
# Previously, this module generated known_marketplaces.json as a Nix store
# symlink (read-only), which prevented Claude Code's "Enable auto-update"
# feature from working (EACCES permission denied).

    # After switching from Nix-managed to Claude-managed known_marketplaces.json,
    # the old symlink to /nix/store/... must be removed so Claude Code can create
    # a writable file in its place.

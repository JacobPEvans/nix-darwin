# Login Activation Recovery
#
# Creates a LaunchAgent that runs after user login to recover from boot
# activation failures. This addresses the issue where nix-darwin's
# activate-system LaunchDaemon fails at boot due to App Management
# permission checks requiring a graphical session.
#
# The activation script requires "Aqua" (graphical session) for the
# App Management permission check. At boot time, there's no GUI yet,
# so activation fails with exit code 1. This LaunchAgent runs after
# login when the graphical session is available.
#
# See: docs/boot-failure/root-cause.md for full explanation

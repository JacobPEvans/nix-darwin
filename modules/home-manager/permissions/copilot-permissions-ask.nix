# GitHub Copilot CLI User-Prompted Commands (ASK List - REFERENCE ONLY)
#
# IMPORTANT: Copilot CLI does NOT have an "ask" mode in config.json. Tool
# permissions are controlled entirely via --allow-tool / --deny-tool CLI flags.
# This file exists ONLY for reference to keep sync with Claude and Gemini.
#
# FILE STRUCTURE:
# - copilot-permissions-allow.nix - Trusted directories (config.json)
# - copilot-permissions-ask.nix (this file) - Commands that would require confirmation (reference only)
# - copilot-permissions-deny.nix - Recommended --deny-tool flags
#
# NOTE: These permission lists are kept in sync across Claude, Gemini, and Copilot.
# Currently each AI has separate files. Future improvement: DRY refactor to share
# common command lists across all AI tools.
#
# The commands below are the same ones in Claude's askList. They are commented
# out because Copilot doesn't use config-based tool permissions - it's purely
# for documentation and to maintain parity across AI tool configurations.
#
# WARNING: Since Copilot CLI doesn't support config-based "ask" mode, you must
# use --deny-tool flags to block dangerous operations, or simply rely on
# Copilot's default behavior of prompting for approval.

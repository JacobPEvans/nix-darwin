# Gemini CLI Auto-Approved Commands (ALLOW List)
#
# Uses unified permission definitions from ai-cli/common/permissions.nix
# with Gemini-specific formatting via formatters.nix.
#
# FORMAT: ShellTool(cmd) for shell commands, plus core tools like ReadFileTool
#
# SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH:
# Command definitions are in ai-cli/common/permissions.nix
# This file only applies Gemini-specific formatting.
#
# CRITICAL - tools.allowed vs tools.core:
# =========================================
# This exports "allowedTools" which maps to "tools.allowed" in settings.json.
# DO NOT rename this to "coreTools" - that would be WRONG!
#
# Per the official Gemini CLI schema:
# - tools.allowed = "Tool names that bypass the confirmation dialog" (AUTO-APPROVE)
# - tools.core = "Allowlist to RESTRICT built-in tools to a specific set" (LIMITS usage!)
#
# Using tools.core LIMITS what tools Gemini can use, it does NOT grant permissions.
# Schema: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/schemas/settings.schema.json

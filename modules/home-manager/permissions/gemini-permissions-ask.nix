# Gemini CLI User-Prompted Commands (ASK List - REFERENCE ONLY)
#
# IMPORTANT: Gemini CLI does NOT have an "ask" mode. Commands are either allowed
# (coreTools) or blocked (excludeTools). This file exists ONLY for reference to
# keep sync with Claude and Copilot permission structures.
#
# FILE STRUCTURE:
# - gemini-permissions-allow.nix - Auto-approved commands (coreTools)
# - gemini-permissions-ask.nix (this file) - Commands that would require confirmation (reference only)
# - gemini-permissions-deny.nix - Permanently blocked commands (excludeTools)
#
# NOTE: These permission lists are kept in sync across Claude, Gemini, and Copilot.
# Currently each AI has separate files. Future improvement: DRY refactor to share
# common command lists across all AI tools.
#
# The commands below are the same ones in Claude's ask list. They are commented
# out because Gemini doesn't use this file - it's purely for documentation and
# to maintain parity across AI tool configurations.
#
# WARNING: Since Gemini CLI doesn't support "ask" mode, users must exercise extra
# caution when using Gemini with these commands. Consider using Claude Code for
# tasks involving these operations if you want confirmation prompts.

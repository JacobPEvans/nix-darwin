# Activation Error Tracking Module
# Provides comprehensive error tracking for darwin-rebuild activation phases
# Helps diagnose failures by tracking which phase failed and why
#
# Problem this solves:
# - The launchctl asuser call (home-manager activation) succeeds but may return
#   exit code 2, causing set -e to abort the entire script
# - Without tracking, we can't see which phase actually failed
# - This leaves users unable to diagnose the real issue
#
# Solution:
# - Track each activation phase with exit codes
# - Allow non-critical phases to fail without aborting (enforced by 'set +e' in preActivation)
# - Report comprehensive error information with timestamps
# - Keep debug output for future diagnostics
# - Follow CRITICAL RULES in docs/ACTIVATION-SCRIPTS-RULES.md:
#   * NEVER use 'set -e' in activation scripts
#   * TREAT ALL ERRORS AS WARNINGS, not fatal failures
#   * Symlink update is the CRITICAL phase - must never abort before it

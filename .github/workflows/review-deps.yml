            You are reviewing a flake.lock update PR for a nix-darwin configuration.

            ## Diff Content
            ```diff
            ${{ steps.diff.outputs.content }}
            ```

            ## Your Task
            1. Analyze the diff above to identify what changed
            2. For each changed input, assess the risk level
            3. Provide a clear recommendation

            ## Risk Levels
            - **LOW**: Routine updates - nixpkgs bumps, patch updates, documentation repos, non-code flake inputs
            - **MEDIUM**: Minor version changes, new features added, repos with breaking change potential
            - **HIGH**: Major version changes, security-related updates, changes to core infrastructure (darwin, home-manager)

            ## Important Context
            - This is a personal nix-darwin config, not production infrastructure
            - The CI already validates the flake builds successfully
            - Fast-moving inputs like nixpkgs and claude-code-plugins update frequently

            ## Your Response Format
            Structure your review as:

            ### Changed Inputs
            List each changed input with old rev (first 7 chars) → new rev (first 7 chars)

            ### Risk Assessment
            For each input, state the risk level and brief reason

            ### Recommendation
            State ONE of these exactly at the end of your review:

            If ALL changes are LOW risk:
            `DECISION: AUTO-MERGE`

            If ANY change is MEDIUM or HIGH risk:
            `DECISION: HOLD - [brief reason]`

            if grep -q "DECISION: AUTO-MERGE" "${{ steps.claude-review.outputs.execution_file }}"; then
              echo "decision=auto-merge" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
# https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates
#
# NOTE: Nix flake inputs are NOT managed by Dependabot
# Dependabot doesn't support Nix flakes, so we use custom GitHub Actions workflows:
#
# Flake Input Update Strategy (unified in deps-update-flake.yml):
# - Schedule: Daily at noon UTC
#   - Tue/Fri: ALL inputs
#   - Other days: AI-focused inputs only
# - repository_dispatch: Instant sync for ai-assistant-instructions
# - deps-monitor-packages.yml: Package version monitoring (Mon 7am, Thu 7pm, Sat 7am UTC)
#
# All commits are signed via GitHub REST API (verified as github-actions[bot]).
# All flake update PRs are automatically reviewed by AI (review-deps.yml).

# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
# https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates
#
# NOTE: Nix flake inputs are NOT managed by Dependabot
# Dependabot doesn't support Nix flakes, so we use custom GitHub Actions workflows:
#
# Flake Input Update Strategy:
# - deps-update-flake.yml: Full update of all inputs (Mon/Thu 6 AM UTC)
# - deps-update-ai-instructions.yml: Immediate sync with ai-assistant-instructions (on push)
# - deps-update-anthropic.yml: Daily fast-track for Anthropic repos (6 AM UTC)
# - deps-monitor-packages.yml: Package version monitoring (Mon 7am, Thu 7pm, Sat 7am UTC)
#
# All flake update PRs are automatically reviewed by AI (review-deps.yml) and may auto-merge
# if deemed low-risk. See .github/workflows/ for implementation details.
